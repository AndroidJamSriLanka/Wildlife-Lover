Finalized APP IDEA- 
		App Name- Wildlife Lover
 
		 App  Description -  Basically app is based on GPS.  And  user will be able to use it even at zero network connectivity. 
							 Purpose of this app is to helping people who loves to travel often and keep their memorial moments with photography.
							 (specially the wild life photography enthusiasts)
							 In a simple note user will be able to tap on app and look for a place where he/she would get to see an specific animal,
							 scenoric area etc. Then app itself should pops up a map that shows where he/she should be visiting for best views 
							 accordingly user's location (search).Most importantly app is built to collect data and grow it self by letting users to 
							 add their own favorable locations that are informative for others.
							 Then we developers won't be having hard time to adding venues, since users are almost developing it by adding greater 
							 reviews to the locations that each and everyone one who finds best on it. 
							 Most importantly users are advised to add venues that's is about hikes/wildlife or great travelers choices.
							 
		API			     - Google Maps Android API v2
		
		Database         - Data base will be XML because this is used on offline and at that time photo details and location is saved in XML and when user connet to interet 
							those data will be saved to cloud.
		


Current Situation - I have done with UploadActivity and ViewActivity GUIs.
