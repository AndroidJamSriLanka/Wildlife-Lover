App Idea 03
 
		 Basically app is based on GPS.  And  user will be able to use it even at zero network connectivity. 
		 Purpose of this app is to helping people who loves to travel often and keep their memorial moments with photography. (specially the wild life photography enthusiasts)
		 In a simple note user will be able to tap on app and look for a place where he/she would get to see an specific animal,scenoric area etc. Then app itself should pops 
		 up a map that shows where he/she should be visiting for best views accordingly user's location (search).Most importantly app is built to collect data and grow it self 
		 by letting users to add their own favorable locations that are informative for others.
		 Then we developers won't be having hard time to adding venues, since users are almost developing it by adding greater reviews to the locations
		 that each and everyone one who finds best on it. 
		 Most importantly users are advised to add venues that's is about hikes/wildlife or great travelers choices.
